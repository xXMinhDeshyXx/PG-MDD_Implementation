# Pytorch Implementation of PG-MDD

This is a pytorch implementation of the paper PG-MDD: Prompt-Guided Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis Leveraging Articulatory Features from 2024 APSIPA ASC. 
Link: http://www.apsipa2024.org/files/papers/438.pdf

The code is the cleaned up version of https://github.com/huutuongtu/Refining-Linguistic-Information-Utilization-MDD/ for easier intepretation.

A proper setup of the dataset used in this repository was also replicated and is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MinhLe999/l2-arctic-cleaned

Run the Timit CTC first then run the Fullmodel
